## 春天和冬天你更喜欢那个季节？

我更喜欢春天，给人一种清新的感觉。

春天有雨，冬天有雪，相对于雪，我更喜欢雨。尤其是那种小雨，淅淅沥沥的，时断时停。在雨中漫步，能够感受春的气息，品味泥土的芳香。

气温的回升，让世间万物都复苏，当然人也不例外，所以大家都感受大自然，或去户外爬山，或去郊区踏青，抑或和朋友一起打球。



## what do you like, spring or winter?

I prefer spring rather than winter. As all know, there is rain in the spring and snow in the winter. I prefer rain to snow. especially a small rain（spit）, it is intermittence. I can walk in the rain , feel the spring and smell the earth.

Also , it is warmer and warmer in the spring, so it make everything in the world become more lively. Of course, we human being can go out with friends to climb, go for a walk in the country . For me, I can play basketball with my friends, Basketball is my favorite sport.
