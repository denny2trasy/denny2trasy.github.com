## 你的日常生活表是怎样的？
在工作日，我通常是7点起床，然后洗漱，7点半左右吃早餐，8点出门去上班，9点开始工作。中午12点半的时候，会和同事在单位附近吃中餐。可以有半个小时的休息时间，1点半开始继续工作，直到下午6点下班。大概在7点左右，我就可以到家，然后着手做晚饭，大概在8点左右，和妻子一起吃晚饭，之后，我开始学习，一直到11点半睡觉。
 
## What is your routine life?

On week days, I always wake up at 7 o'clock, and then brash my teeth. At 7:30am, I have breakfast and go out to work at 8 o'clock. I normally start work at 9am in the morning and usually have my lunch with co-worker near my office, after that I have half an hour for rest. Then I go on working at 1:30pm, till 6:00pm I finish my whole day work. Usually I can get home about 7pm, and then start to cook my dinner. About 8pm , I take my dinner with my wife. After that I start till 11pm, and then go to bed.

## 一段时间集中处理一件事是多么关键，多么重要！ How important focus on one thing one time!
